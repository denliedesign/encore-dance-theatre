            Encore Dance Theatre’s All Star teams were created for the dancer that wants to grow in dance, have a passion for performing and giving back to their community. Our goal is to expose our dancers to different genres of dance while working on creating a foundation that will help them become well rounded dancers. We look for motivated dancers with good work ethic and dedication both inside and outside of the studio.
            <br><br>
            Dance aside, the students learn “More Than Just Great Dancing” here at EDT. They learn discipline, focus, teamwork, responsibility and much more! Most of these students are on the honor roll and understand they must balance school and dance in order to compete.
            <br><br>
            In order to be considered, dancers must be enrolled in classes at Encore Dance Theatre for at least one year and meet the minimum requirements listed below.

    <div class="container py-4">
        <p class="text-center" style="font-size: 1.25em">
        Our Company is a team that was formed for the serious dancer who would like to pursue dance in their future. To be in the Company it takes hard work and dedication. Each team member takes an average of 8-12 hours a week, trains in every genre of dance and is serious about their craft.
            <br><br>
        These inspiring girls pour their hearts and souls into dance daily, devoting a majority of their free time to dance. To give you an idea of their commitment levels, throughout each season they take a required four hours of ballet each week, plus jazz, contemporary, pointe, strength training, tap, hip-hop, musical theatre and acrobatics. They train hard and are very focused on reaching their full potential. Our goal is for them to become well-rounded dancers and it is our hope that one day they will take their training with them and either receive a college scholarship or become a professional dancer, if that is what they choose.
